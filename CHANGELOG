## [Unreleased]

### Added

### Changed

### Fixed

## Removed

## [1.2.0] - 2023-12-18

### Added

- Add inference to dropout layers
- Add 2D and 3D batch normalisation layers
- Add 1D and 4D flatten layers
- Add predict procedure to network_type
- Add network reset procedure
- Add Adam optimiser
- Add procedures to get and set network parameters 
- Add procedures to get and set network gradients
- Add procedure to get layer output
- Add new test directory
   - Test jobs test the working of the library
- Add test jobs
- Add more example jobs
   - Example jobs show the functionality of the library
   - batchnorm, dropblock, 3D, sine, and simple function
- Add average pooling 2D and 3D layers
- Add RMSprop, Adam, and Adagrad optimisers
- Add learning rate decay

### Changed

- Handle batch size in each layer
- As such, increase rank of io data (and gradients) for all layers by 1
- Handle loss and metric network initialisation in separate procedures
- Convert optimiser to parent and derived types
- Change optimise procedure to minimise
- Handle network learning in network, rather than individual layers
- Rename test/ to example/
- network_tyep%forward now handles assumed rank
- input_layer_type%set now handles assumed rank
- Add abstract conv, pool, and batch layer types
- All layer forward and backward passes take defined shape
   - Previously, rank was defined and shape was assumed
- Flatten layers now use output_shape as well as num_outputs
- Make accuracy score functions available to import

### Fixed

- Fix drop inference
- Fix backpropagation for overlapping windows in maxpool layers
- Fix dropblock 2D and 3D generate_mask to check for .lt. gamma instead of .gt.
   - This was already correctly handled in dropout
- Fix R2 score function
   - Add zero division check

## Removed

- Remove mod_batch_norm.f90
- Remove update procedure from learnable_layer_types
- Remove parameter velocities from learnable_layer_types
